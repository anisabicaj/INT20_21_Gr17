                <b>New York</b>
                New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with around <u>8.5 million residents.</u>
                Contrary to what you might think, New York City is <mark>the greenest city in America.</mark>
                The 843-acre Central Park, the most famous park in the city, is actually only the 5th largest. 
                Jog, walk, bike, in-line skate, horseback ride, ice skate, rent row boats, play basketball, softball,
                soccer, tennis and enjoy special events.One of the most quintessential things to do in <abbr title="New York City">NYC</abbr> is
                shopping (window shopping counts!); poke around the shops that line Fifth and Madison
                Avenues where you can find high-end designer labels and check out the seasonal, museum-worthy 
                window displays. Of all the things to do in New York, one of the most exciting is seeking out the
                best views of the city skyline. Head to either the Top of the Rock or Empire State Building
                (or both to compare the views!). Both attractions include exhibits that explore New York City’s
                rich history before you board an elevator to get sky-high views.
