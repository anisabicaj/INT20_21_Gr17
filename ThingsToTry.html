        Maybe you've never thought of yourself as the "artistic type," but everyone has a creative side. Experiment with paint, make a piece of jewelry, or craft something you saw on Pinterest — all of these activities will sharpen your creative abilities, which in turn will improve your problem solving skills and give you a fresh perspective on life.</dd>

    <dd>
        When you've lived somewhere your whole life, it can be hard to see the things that make your town truly special. Act like a tourist for a day in your own hometown by researching the city to find out what special attractions it has, its best restaurants, and its best parks. Wander around your town with a plan to see everything (or as much as you can) that makes it special. You'll see it in a way you never have before.</dd>

This is something you'll look back on and feel great about, which will give you an instant boost of confidence to tackle whatever lies ahead of you. Checking off that athletic goal will make you say, "I did that, now I can do anything."</dd>
